# Atari 2600 PlusCart


## Description
the Atari 2600 PlusCart ist based on Robin Edwards Unocart-2600 (https://github.com/robinhedwards/UnoCart-2600). The PlusCart has no SD-Card, but an ESP8266 to connect to a local WiFi Network and the Internet.
The PlusCart downloads the ROM-files from an Server in the Internet called the "PlusStore". The way this is done is similar to the way the Unocart-2600 loads ROMs from the FAT filesystem on the SD-card, while the VCS is performing a waitroutine in his RAM.

## PlusROM
Additionally the PlusCart has one more interesting feature. It offers **internet access** to the ROM Developers, these functions are called "[PlusROM](http://pluscart.firmaplus.de/pico/?PlusROM)".
