;Here's the source code for that first digital online clock PlusROM programme.
;Feel free to employ and distribute this code however you may wish.
;Both the source code and the binary are public domain.
;
;This Code is basically Chris "Crackers" Cracknell's code from:
;https://www.biglist.com/cgi-bin/wilma/wilma_hiliter/stella/199710/msg00071.html
;
;Added are just the PlusROM functionality of sending and receiving bytes from
;an internet host.
;The clock sends every minute a request to the backend API, and receives in the
;response the actual hours, minutes and seconds
;(in the right format for HOURS, MINS and SECS)
